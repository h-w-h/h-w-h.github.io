<p class="message">
  Welcome to my home page. I am a third year graduate student in the Math Department at UCLA. I completed my undergraduate studies at Walla Walla University with majors in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics. My primary area of research interest is optimization. Particular specialization interests include iterative fixed-point methods for solving convex feasibility problems and their applications to image processing (e.g., denoising and image reconstruction).

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
