<p class="message">
My primary area of research interest is optimization. Particular specialization interests include iterative projection methods for solving convex feasibility problems and their applications to image processing (e.g., denoising and image reconstruction).


Two subtopics in this realm are of particular interest. The first is superiorization, which is a heuristic methodology that lies somewhere between the feasibility-seaking and constrained minimization branches of optimization. See Professor Yair Censor's webpage for a comprehensive bibliography of papers on this topic. The second is asynchronous algorithms, which aim to introduce robustness and greater computational efficiency when solving fixed point problems.
