> I began tutoring collegiate math in 2012. This includes tutoring for the Teaching Learning Center at Walla Walla University (Fall 2012-June 2016), the Math Department (Spring 2013) and Physics Department (Winter 2015 - Spring 2016) at Walla Walla University. I am now a Teaching Assistant at UCLA (since Fall 2016). I am able to tutor many standard undergraduate math courses, ranging from lower division calculus to upper division real analysis, optimization, and others (e.g., 31AB, 32AB, 33AB, 115AB, 151A, 131AB, 146, 164, 170A, etc.).
